- `clear` - Clear screen
- `personality [description]` - Set AI personality
- `help` - Show help message

## Security

This project uses environment variables to keep your API key secure:
- API keys are stored in `.env` file (not tracked by Git)
- Never hardcode API keys in source code
- `.gitignore` prevents accidental key exposure

## Requirements

- Google Colab account
- Google AI Studio API key
- Internet connection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **API Key Errors**: Make sure your key starts with 'AIza'
2. **Model Not Found**: Run `test_simple_request()` to find working models
3. **500 Errors**: Usually temporary, try again or use different model

### Getting Help:
- Run `fix_common_issues()` for guided troubleshooting
- Check that your API key is from Google AI Studio (not Google Cloud)
